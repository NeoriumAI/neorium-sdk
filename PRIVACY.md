Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

Overview

Neorium is committed to protecting user privacy and maintaining transparency.
This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled when using Neorium products, including the Neorium SDK, browser extension, and related developer tools.

Neorium is designed as a privacy-respecting, developer-focused platform. We do not sell, rent, or trade user data.

Data Collection

Neorium does not collect personal identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or wallet private keys.

The following data may be processed only when required for functionality:

Temporary session data

User-defined configuration and preferences

Anonymous technical metadata required to process AI requests

All data is handled with a minimal-collection principle.

Local Storage

Neorium may store limited data locally in the user’s browser or environment, including:

Extension settings and preferences

Temporary session identifiers

Cached responses for performance optimization

This data remains under the user’s control and can be removed at any time by clearing browser storage or uninstalling the extension.

AI & SDK Processing

When using AI features, user-initiated requests may be sent to authorized Neorium services or user-configured AI endpoints.

Neorium does not:

Train AI models using user data

Store AI request content longer than necessary for processing

Share AI data with unauthorized third parties

Browser Permissions

Neorium requests only the permissions required to operate:

Storage — to save local settings and preferences

Side Panel / UI permissions — to display the assistant interface

Tab access (limited) — only when user context is required and explicitly requested

Host permissions — to communicate with trusted Neorium endpoints

Permissions are never used for tracking, profiling, or advertising.

Third-Party Services

Neorium may integrate with third-party APIs or infrastructure services solely to enable core functionality (such as AI processing).

All integrations follow strict security and privacy standards. Neorium does not authorize third parties to use user data beyond the intended purpose.

Security

Neorium applies industry-standard security practices to protect data, including:

Encrypted communication channels

Restricted access to services

Regular internal review of permission scope and data handling

However, no system can guarantee absolute security.

Open Source Transparency

Neorium SDK and related tools are open-source.
Users are encouraged to review the codebase to understand exactly how data is handled.

Transparency and auditability are core values of the Neorium ecosystem.

Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
Any changes will be reflected in this document with an updated revision date.

Continued use of Neorium after changes implies acceptance of the updated policy.
